# <{Prework-Study-Guide Webpage}>

## Description

This webpage was created to help coding students learn HTML,CSS,JavaScript, and Git. This project was built as a framework to add more notes to as time progresses. Building this project was also an introduction to learning the basics of coding, such as: creating for loops and functions. GitHub was also utilized to keep track of the various steps of the project by creating new branches and merging them with the main branch after each one was completed.
